# create a reference database for the BLAST search with terminal/commandline NCBI BLAST+:
# using the FASTA file of motifs created in the script 'predictortool_part1.py'

cd /path-to-database
makeblastdb -in gyramotifs.fas -dbtype prot

 
 # query the nucleotide sequence of interest against this BLAST database:

blastx -query query_sequence.fasta -db gyramotifs.fasta -qcov_hsp_perc 80 -out outputfile.txt -outfmt 6

# the BLAST search generates a text file with the following columns: 
# query sequence ID | reference sequence ID | percentage identical matches | alignment length (sequence overlap) 
# number of mismatches | number of gap openings | start of alignment in query | end of alignment in query 
# start of alignment in reference | end of alignment in reference | expect value | bit score 

# the phenotype of the top motif hit (which was defined in 'predictortool_part1.py') is then used to predict the phenotype of the query sequence

# ResistancePredictorTool
This tool was developed as part of the University of Oxford MBiol FHS Part II project, 2022-23. Candidate number: 1043649.

This repository contains the script (parts 1 & 2) for the predictor tool.


Additional downloads are required to reproduce this script on the user's computer (Miniconda or Anaconda to install Python packages; NCBI BLAST+ to query the sequence of interest). The tool is in the process of being integrated into PubMLST, which will remove the need for access to the user's local computer.
